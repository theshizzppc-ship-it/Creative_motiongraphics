# Vox-Style Prompt Templates

Everything here feeds Phases 1 and 3 of the pipeline. The goal of every
prompt is the same: a **motion-designed editorial collage** — the visual
grammar of a Vox video — never a filmed scene.

## The visual vocabulary

Draw scenes from this palette of devices. Every block should combine two or
three of them, chosen to literally illustrate that block's narration line.

- **Archival cutouts** — photographic subjects (people, buildings, objects)
  cut out with rough white paper borders, drifting or snapping into place
  over flat backgrounds. Photos live *inside* the collage as elements; the
  frame as a whole is never live-action.
- **Flat color fields** — bold editorial backdrops: warm yellow, off-white
  paper, deep navy, coral red. One dominant color per block, consistent
  accent palette across the whole video.
- **Paper & print textures** — grain, halftone dots, newsprint, torn edges,
  tape strips, subtle drop shadows that sell the "cut and pasted" feel.
- **Hand-drawn annotations** — marker circles drawing themselves around a
  cutout, underlines sweeping in, arrows connecting elements, scribbled
  emphasis strokes. (Abstract strokes only — never letters or words.)
- **Abstract data graphics** — bar charts growing, line graphs drawing
  themselves upward, pie slices separating, unlabeled — pure shape and
  motion, no numerals, no axis text.
- **Maps** — flat stylized maps with animated routes, pulsing location dots,
  regions filling with color.
- **Redaction & highlight blocks** — solid color bars sliding over areas,
  spotlight vignettes isolating one cutout while the rest dims.
- **Scale comparisons** — one object multiplying into rows, a small cutout
  next to a towering one, stacks growing.

## Motion vocabulary

Vox motion is snappy and intentional: quick ease-out entrances, elements
sliding/popping into place with slight overshoot, slow deliberate camera
push-ins during "listen to this" beats, whip-pans or page-flips between
ideas, parallax drift between collage layers. Something should always be
moving, but only one thing should be *loud* at a time.

## STYLE KEY prompt

Generate this once in any image generator, then attach the resulting image
as a reference to every clip.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Type | image |
| Aspect ratio | match the video — 9:16 vertical or 16:9 |
| Model tip | any strong stylized-image model |
| Used for | reference image on ALL clips |

Editorial mixed-media collage style swatch, Vox-documentary motion graphics
aesthetic: flat warm yellow and off-white paper background with halftone dot
texture, archival photo cutouts with rough white paper borders, torn paper
edges and tape strips, hand-drawn black marker circles and arrows, bold flat
color blocks in navy and coral, subtle paper grain and drop shadows.
Abstract composition only — no characters, no objects with faces, no
letters, no words, no numbers. Non-photorealistic, no live-action, no
realism, no 3D render.
```

## STYLE tokens (used in every block prompt's STYLE REFERENCE line)

```
editorial mixed-media collage, archival photo cutouts with white paper
borders, flat bold color fields, halftone and paper grain textures,
hand-drawn marker annotations, snappy motion-graphics animation,
non-photorealistic, no live-action
```

## Block prompt template

One per block, labeled, no timecodes:

```
Block {N}
STYLE REFERENCE: Match the attached style key EXACTLY — {STYLE tokens}.
SCENE: {the collage composition that illustrates this block's narration line:
which cutouts, which color field, which annotations/charts/maps}.
MOTION: {entrance choreography + camera move + what animates during the shot}.
AUDIO: {ambient bed + one or two paper/whoosh/tick SFX — no voice, no narration}.
NEGATIVE: readable text, letters, words, numbers, captions, subtitles,
watermark, logo, photorealism, live-action footage, 3D render, lip-sync,
talking characters, color drift.
```

The NEGATIVE line is fixed — copy it verbatim into every block. The scene
must visualize the narration's *idea*, not depict someone saying it.

## Worked examples

Narration (Block 1): *"Every day, humans throw away enough food to feed two
billion people. And most of it never even reaches a plate."*

```
Block 1
STYLE REFERENCE: Match the attached style key EXACTLY — editorial mixed-media
collage, archival photo cutouts with white paper borders, flat bold color
fields, halftone and paper grain textures, hand-drawn marker annotations,
snappy motion-graphics animation, non-photorealistic, no live-action.
SCENE: A warm yellow paper background with halftone texture. Photo cutouts of
apples, bread loaves and a full dinner plate snap into a neat grid, then one
by one flip over and tumble downward off-frame into a torn-paper "bin" shape
at the bottom. A thick black marker circle draws itself around the last
remaining plate.
MOTION: Cutouts pop in with slight overshoot in quick succession; slow camera
push-in as they begin tumbling; the marker circle draws in one confident
stroke at the end.
AUDIO: Soft paper rustles and quick whoosh ticks as cutouts flip and fall,
low minimal ambient pulse underneath — no voice, no narration.
NEGATIVE: readable text, letters, words, numbers, captions, subtitles,
watermark, logo, photorealism, live-action footage, 3D render, lip-sync,
talking characters, color drift.
```

Narration (mid-video evidence block): *"In nineteen seventy, shipping one
container across the ocean cost ten times what it does today. Then the boxes
took over."*

```
Block 4
STYLE REFERENCE: Match the attached style key EXACTLY — editorial mixed-media
collage, archival photo cutouts with white paper borders, flat bold color
fields, halftone and paper grain textures, hand-drawn marker annotations,
snappy motion-graphics animation, non-photorealistic, no live-action.
SCENE: Deep navy background. A stylized flat world map slides up from the
bottom; a coral dotted route draws itself across the ocean between two
pulsing dots. An archival photo cutout of a cargo ship rides along the route
while an abstract bar chart on the right shrinks step by step, its tallest
bar collapsing to a stub. Torn-paper container shapes multiply into a
growing stack.
MOTION: Map slides in with ease-out; route line draws left to right; camera
drifts laterally following the ship; bars shrink with snappy steps; container
stack builds with rhythmic pops.
AUDIO: Low ambient hum, soft tick per bar step, gentle ocean-paper whoosh —
no voice, no narration.
NEGATIVE: readable text, letters, words, numbers, captions, subtitles,
watermark, logo, photorealism, live-action footage, 3D render, lip-sync,
talking characters, color drift.
```

## Script example (structure reference, 6 blocks = 1 minute)

Topic: "Why food waste is a supply-chain story"

```
Block 1  Every day, humans throw away enough food to feed two billion
         people. And most of it never even reaches a plate.
Block 2  We blame picky eaters and overfull fridges. But the biggest losses
         happen long before you ever see the food.
Block 3  Nearly forty percent of waste in poorer countries happens at the
         farm — crops rot waiting for trucks that never come.
Block 4  Rich countries flipped the problem. Their food survives the journey,
         then dies in supermarkets chasing perfect-looking produce.
Block 5  Here's the twist: fixing trucks and fridges would cut more waste
         than every household campaign combined.
Block 6  So the fight against food waste isn't in your kitchen. It's in the
         boring machinery that moves dinner around the world.
```

Notice the shape: cold-open stat → stakes → two evidence beats → the turn →
kicker that reframes Block 1. Each line is one idea, ~20–24 words, numbers
spelled out, no filler.
